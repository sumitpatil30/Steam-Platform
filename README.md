# Insights

All the insights are divided into 7 parts:
1. Overall
2. Ownership
3. Engagement
4. Publisher and Developer
5. Game Genre
6. Free-to-play games vs Paid games
7. Game release date


1. Overall
   - Total number of games on Steam are 46,101
   - Median price of games on Steam is USD 5
   - Median Positive Percent for all games on Steam is 0.78
   - There are specific price points for games on Steam which are USD 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 

2. Ownership
• 69.18% of games are owned by less than 20 thousand players
• 1% of games are owned by 1 mil to 2 mil players
3. Engagement
• 75.36% of all games are non-active games
• 23.57% of active games have less than 1 hour of median playtime
Inference: 1. Median Positive Percent for all games is 0.78 This means that roughly 3 
out of 4 people have rated games as positive. But rating a game as positive does not 
necessarily mean that games will have more playtime. As 75.36% of all games are nonactive games. So we need to look at some other metric to know why a player is not 
actually playing a game.
4. Publisher and Developer
• ‘Choice of Games’ is the biggest developer on steam
• Median price for ‘Choice of Games’ (biggest developer) is USD 4.99
• ‘Big Fish Games’ is the biggest publisher on steam
• Median price for ‘Big Fish Games’ (biggest publisher) is USD 9.99
5. Game genre
• Top 5 genre for all games are: 
1. 'Indie' 
2. 'Action' 
3. 'Casual'
4. 'Adventure'
5. 'Strategy'
• All game genre categories have increased between 2014 and 2020
• Number of 'Casual' games released has increased 10.34 times between 2014 and 
2020
6. Free-to-play games vs Paid games
• 15.47% of all games on steam are free to play games
• When player base is less than 20 thousand, more players are playing paid games
• But as player base crosses 1 mil, more players are playing free-to-play-games
• Top 5 genre for both free-to-play games and paid games are same
• 19% of Free-to-play games have Massively Multiplayer genre
• Only 2% of Paid games have Massively Multiplayer genre
Inference: 2. Between 2014 and 2020 all game genre have increased. Most 
significant increase has been in ‘Casual’ game genre. This is also in top 5 genre for 
paid games. Hence, ‘Casual’ paid game represents an opportunity which can be 
explored for monetization. 
Inference: 3. In Massively Multiplayer genre there is significant difference in number 
of games for paid vs free-to-play. One possible reason could be this: ‘Massively 
Multiplayer genre are played by group of people who are friends in real life. Not 
everyone in the group is ready to pay for such game’. The available data is not 
sufficient to test this hypothesis. 
7. Game release date
• Number of games released have increased at a CAGR of 43.47% between 2014 and 
2018
• Maximum number of games are released in month of August

significantly large
• Release of games are spread evenly across all months
• 44.57% of all games are released in both Week 1 and Week 2 combined
• 46.26% of all games are released in Week 3
